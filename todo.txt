Create control panel:
    SLide control for:
        Lifespan
        Mutation Rate
        Breeding rate


In creatures.py:
    Create separate method for dealing with mutations, currently in
    World.mating():

        Should be created to support multiple creature classes, not just
        the predator class.

        Should be able to iterate through mutliple genes for affect
        all attributes with genes in any particular creature class.

        Rate should be controlled by a slider in the control panel.

    Check into Kivy's collision algorithm and create a more efficient one
    if necessary.
